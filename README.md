## 1. Setting Up the Framework:

Create the Core Classes: Build the classes that handle routing and middleware processing.
Implement Routing: Define routes, their associated handlers, and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Middleware Execution: Develop middleware layers to intercept and process requests.

## 2. Create Sample API Endpoints:

Define Endpoints: Set up multiple API endpoints with different functionalities.
Handle Requests: Implement actions for these endpoints to perform (retrieve data, save data, delete data, etc.).

## 3. Demonstration:

Basic Routing: Show how different routes trigger their respective handlers.
Middleware Execution: Demonstrate how middleware intercepts requests before reaching the endpoint handlers.
Request and Response Handling: Showcase how requests are received, processed, and appropriate responses are sent back.
Error Handling: Illustrate how errors or exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.
Documentation: Create clear documentation explaining how to use your framework, including sample code snippets.

## 4. Building a Sample Application:

Use Your Framework: Develop a simple application (e.g., CRUD operations on a specific entity) using your framework.
Explain Functionality: Walk through the code, highlighting how your framework simplifies the process of building APIs.

## 5. Testing:

Unit Testing: Create tests to ensure that routing, middleware, and endpoints work as expected.
Integration Testing: Test how your framework interacts with different scenarios and edge cases.

## 6. Presentation:

Live Demonstration: Show the framework in action through live coding or a pre-built demo.
Explain Design Choices: Discuss why you made specific design decisions in the framework.
Q&A Session: Allow for questions and feedback from the audience.

## 7. Publishing and Sharing:

GitHub Repository: Share your code on a platform like GitHub.
Documentation and Tutorials: Write comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help others understand and use your framework.
Community Engagement: Engage with the PHP developer community to gather feedback and improve your framework.

## Additional Tips:

Keep it Simple: Focus on clarity and simplicity in your demonstration.
Visual Aids: Use diagrams or visual representations to explain the flow of requests and middleware execution.
Performance Benchmarking: If possible, compare the performance of your framework against existing solutions.
